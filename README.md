This notebook mainly tells how to create data for feeding into ML algorithms, also I tried to visulize data as well as use computations to find correlations between.
We learn to split data into training_set and testing_set and and also use stratified sampling to make it better than random sampling

We have done this both by convential user defined modules and then using predefined functions from SciKit learn.

Modules to be used:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Scikit-learn

We have used three ML regression and used cross-validation to get the error in predictions by the models
